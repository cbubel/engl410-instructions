        <h2>0. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This guide will cover the installation of an LGA1150 Intel processor. It is assumed that the processor is brand new and the motherboard is already installed in the case. It is also assumed that an older processor was already removed from the processor socket on the motherboard and that the power supply has been unplugged.

        <h2>1. Materials Needed</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Intel processor based on the LGA1150 socket *</li>
          <p class="info">
            <strong>Note</strong>: LGA1150 is simply a socket type. Both the motherboard and processor need to be of socket LGA1150 in order to fit together properly.
          </p>
          <li>Heatsink with factory-applied thermal paste *</li>
          <li>Motherboard with LGA1150 socket</li>
          <li>Optional: Anti-static band</li>
          <p class="warning">
            <strong>Warning</strong>: While not required, it is recommended that you ground yourself with an anti-static band to avoid shorting the components. If you do not have a band, make sure to touch a metal object around your work area, such as the computer case, to discharge yourself.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p class="follow-up">
          * These items typically come bundled together in the box for a new Intel processor

        <h2>2. Setting up your workspace</h2>
        <p>
          On a flat surface, such as a table, prepare your components for installation.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Remove the processor from the box, leaving it in its protective cover</li>
          <li>Remove the heatsink from the box</li>
          <li>Set aside both components for now</li>
          <li>Lay the computer case down and remove the side cover, exposing the motherboard</li>
          <a href="img/1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/1.jpg" alt="Workspace setup"></a>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="primary-section">
        <h2>3. Installing the processor</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>On the side of the processor socket on the motherboard, first push the lever down, outwards, and finally up to fully lift the protective cover off the socket</li>
          <a href="img/3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/3.jpg" alt="Cover open"></a>
          <li>Remove the processor from its protective plastic shell</li>
          <p class="warning">
            <strong>Warning</strong>: When handling the processor, make sure not to touch the pins on the bottom of it.
          </p>
          <li>Insert the processor into the socket by matching up the starting pin arrows on the corner of the processor and socket *</li>
          <a href="img/4.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/4.jpg" alt="CPU inserted"></a>
          <p class="warning">
            <strong>Warning</strong>: When preparing to insert the processor into the motherboard, make sure not to touch the socket pins on the motherboard. To avoid bending the pins, do not place the processor into the socket at an angle. Slowly lower it directly in.
          </p>
          <li>Push the lever back down into its locked position</li>
          <a href="img/5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/5.jpg" alt="Lever closed over CPU"></a>
        </ol>
        <p class="follow-up">
          * If the motherboard does not have an arrow, it will at least have small divets into which the processor can only fit one way
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="primary-section">
        <h2>4. Installing the heatsink</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Position the heatsink over the processor with the fasteners aligned over the board openings and so that the fan cable will be able to reach the nearby pins</li>
          <a href="img/6.jpg" target="_blank"><img id="img-special" src="img/6.jpg" alt="Heatsink fasteners"></a>
          <a href="img/7.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/7.jpg" alt="Heatsink positioned"></a>
          <p class="warning">
            <strong>Warning</strong>: Make sure beforehand that the fasteners are fully rotated counter-clockwise. This denotes the locked position.
          </p>
          <li>Push down on the first fastener until it locks in place</li>
          <a href="img/8.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/8.jpg" alt="Heatsink locked in"></a>
          <li>Repeat step 3 on the opposite fastener</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 on the remaining fasteners</li>
          <li>Connect the 4-pin fan cable to the nearby connector</li>
          <a href="img/9.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/9.jpg" alt="Fan pins"></a>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="primary-section">
        <h2>5. Finishing up</h2>
        <ul>
          <a href="img/10.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/10.jpg" alt="CPU installed"></a>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You should now have a successfully installed LGA1150 Intel processor. Reseal the case with the cover and test your machine!
